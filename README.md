# EboardDatingSimLMAO

Premise: You meet the Eboard at Wednesday's meeting, and you decide that you want to get closer to them. Choose an eboard member and hope you get lucky!

Everyone is available on different days. The hang out situation depends on how many times the player chose to hang out with you. <br>
Example: I am available on Wednesday, Friday, and Monday. If the player chooses me on Wednesday, they watch reels with me. IF they skip me on wednesday, but hang with me on friday, we will still watch reels.  Alternatively, if they choose me for Wenesday AND Friday, they will experience a new hangout on Friday since they chose me a 2nd time.

The game takes place over 6 days, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and finally the next Wednesday. On the next wednesday, the ending the player recieves is revealed and they get to see if the eboard members like them or not.

Try to follow the following SIN during your route. Not necessary, but it'd be funnier. <br>
Sam - Wrath <br>
Calvin - Sloth <br>
Sebastian - Gluttony <br>
Alex - Pride <br>
Yaseen - Greed <br>

Someone will make the route for Mc.Rib, undecided rn. <br>
Bear - Envy

The player fills this final sin, try to make them a bit thirsty for you i guess. <br>
Player - Lust

This is how many days you guys each get, and when you are avilable. i.e. how many different hangouts you have to make.  Let us know if you want more/less. <br>
Sam - 3 days - [insert availability] <br>
Calvin - 3 days - [insert availability] <br>
Sebastian - 3 days - [insert availability] <br>
Alex - 2 days - [insert availability] <br>
Yaseen - 2 days - [insert availability]
