# EboardDatingSimLMAO

Premise: You meet the Eboard at Wednesday's meeting, and you decide that you want to get closer to them. Choose an eboard member and hope you get lucky!

Everyone is available on different days. The hang out situation depends on how many times the player chose to hang out with you. <br>
Example: I am available on Wednesday, Friday, and Monday. If the player chooses me on Wednesday, they watch reels with me. IF they skip me on wednesday, but hang with me on friday, we will still watch reels.  Alternatively, if they choose me for Wenesday AND Friday, they will experience a new hangout on Friday since they chose me a 2nd time.

The game takes place over 6 days, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and finally the next Wednesday. On the next wednesday, the ending the player receives is revealed and they get to see if the eboard members like them or not. On that last day, each member's ending will run through, so be sure to account for endings if you didn't completely finish someones route (e.g. you only hang out with them once and don't see the rest of their route)

Try to follow the following SIN during your route. Not necessary, but it'd be funnier. <br>
Sam - Wrath <br>
Calvin - Sloth <br>
Sebastian - Gluttony <br>
Alex - Pride <br>
Yaseen - Greed <br>

Someone will make the route for Mc.Rib, undecided rn. <br>
Bear - Envy

The player fills this final sin, try to make them a bit thirsty for you i guess. <br>
Player - Lust

This is how many days you guys each get, and when you are avilable. i.e. how many different hangouts you have to make.  Let us know if you want more/less. <br>
Sam - 3 days - [insert availability] <br>
Calvin - 3 days - [insert availability] <br>
Sebastian - 3 days - [insert availability] <br>
Alex - 2 days - [insert availability] <br>
Yaseen - 2 days - [insert availability]

File Structure: <br>
Within the "game" folder is a script with your name on it. start there. Please put any NEW folders/files under the "game" folder. 

General Length: <br>
Each day should be between 100 to 250 lines of dialogue / code. Feel free to go above or below depending on what other content is in your route (like minigames or watching reels)

Sprites and Images: <br>
Try to take pictures of yourself for different sprites. Background can be drawn or actual real life pictures. I think it's funnier if it just kept changing per route.
